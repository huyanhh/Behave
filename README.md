# Behave
Trakemon is a mobile application that uses positive reinforcement to teach children about responsibility and social conduct. 
We chose to do this project because we know how stressful it can be for parents to constantly have to remind their children to 
help out at home and teach them how to behave and treat others with respect. We chose a mobile platform because our target audience
(parents and especially children) are very familiar with this platform and also because we wanted to learn about the different 
aspects involved in mobile development.

# Components
## Client
We use Java to develop the Android client. 

## Server
The backend is run on Firebase, an infrastructure that allows us to use it as a database and user authentication. According to the page,

“Firebase is a mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high-quality apps, grow your user base, and earn more money. 
Firebase is made up of complementary features that you can mix-and-match to fit your needs.”
